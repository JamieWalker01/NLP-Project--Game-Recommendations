# Game Recommendations, an NLP project
## A short project using NLP to predict whether a user would recommend a game based on their reviews. 

# Data cleaning 
### - Removed URLs
### - Removed extra white space
### - Removed special charecters and punctuation
### - Removed stop words
### - Lemmatization

# Building the model
### I constructed a baseline model just using the users' reviews. I then attempted to improve the model by adding other features, using different classifiers and using the Tf-idf transformer, but could not improve the baseline model.
